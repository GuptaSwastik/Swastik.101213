<p style="font-size:30px;text-align:center;margin-bottom: 50px;">Manned Missions:
Human Spaceflight: Involving astronauts in space for scientific research, technology testing, or space tourism. 
Space Station Missions: Establishing and maintaining space stations like the International Space Station (ISS) for long-duration experiments. 
Lunar Missions: Exploring the Moon, either with manned landers and rovers or with robotic probes. 
Unmanned Missions:
Flyby Missions: Spacecraft passes by a celestial body without entering orbit for initial reconnaissance. 
Orbiter Missions: Spacecraft enters and orbits a celestial body for detailed, long-term observation. 
Lander Missions: Spacecraft descends to the surface of a celestial body for landing and exploration. 
Rover Missions: Self-propelled vehicles that travel across the surface of a celestial body, collecting data and samples. 
Probe Missions: Include atmospheric probes, penetrator probes (impact probes), and sample return missions. 
Observatory Missions: Space telescopes and observatories for astronomical observations. 
Earth Observation Missions: Satellites and probes for studying Earth's atmosphere, climate, and surface. 
Communication and Navigation Missions: Satellites for telecommunications and navigation. 
Examples of Space Missions:
Apollo Program: A series of manned missions, culminating in the first lunar landing with Apollo 11. 
International Space Station (ISS): A cooperative research facility in Earth orbit. 
Voyager Missions: Flyby missions to outer planets, including Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. 
Mars Missions: Exploration of Mars through orbiters, landers, and rovers like the Mars 2020 mission with the Perseverance rover and Ingenuity helicopter. 
Europa Clipper: A mission to explore Jupiter's moon Europa, investigating its potential ocean. 
BepiColombo: A mission to explore Mercury. 
Scientific
The BepiColombo mission is based on two spacecrafts, one is to map the planet and another to investigate its magnetosphere. Among ...
